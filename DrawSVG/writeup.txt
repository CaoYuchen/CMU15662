Task 1:
    Notice that glColor4f() requires value of color from 0 to 1, unlike the software_renderer one with 0 to 255.
    Fully implemented.

Task 2:
    Note that when |(y1-y0)/(x1-x0)| is larger than 1, it is not easy to calculate the approximate points of y+e as x+1,
    it's better to make step long y, and to calculate x+e, which means inverse the ratio.
    Fully implemented.

Task 3:
    If we first draw the lines of triangle, we don't need to consider the situation of Barycentric Algorithm,
     where ratio of cross product equals 0 and sum of ratio of cross product is 1.
    Fully implemented.

Task 4:

    Fully implemented.

Task 5:

    Fully implemented.

Task 6:

Task 7:

    Fully implemented.
